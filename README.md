# Smart Crutch Project

This project aims to develop a smart crutch designed to assist individuals with mobility issues. The crutch includes several smart features such as pressure-sensitive LEDs, a fall detection buzzer, and automatic lighting in low-light conditions.

## Features

- **Pressure Sensor (BMP280):** Measures the pressure applied by the user and adjusts LED brightness accordingly.
- **Gyro Sensor (MPU6050):** Detects falls and activates a buzzer to alert nearby people.
- **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR):** Senses ambient light levels and turns on LEDs in low-light conditions.

## Components

- BMP280 Pressure Sensor
- MPU6050 Gyro Sensor
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- LEDs
- Buzzer
- Switch
- Arduino Board
